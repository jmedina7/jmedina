				<h3>Our History</h3>

					<div>

						<figure><img src="images/oldjuggler.jpg" alt="An Older Member"/></figure>

						<p>The Strong Jugglers were founded in 1995 when a group of students began going to Strong Hospital to juggle for young patients. The group soon expanded to a University of Rochester campus organization with regular practices and shows. We provide a space for expression, sharing and teaching of juggling and other circus arts. Staying true to our origins, we continue to make trips to Strong Hospital to teach patients how to juggle.</p>

				<h3>Club Meetings</h3>

					<div>

						<p>We meet Tuesdays and Thursdays during the academic year, from roughly 7:00-9:00pm on tuesdays, and 6:00-8:00pm on thursdays, in the May Room (4th floor of Wilson Commons), or occasionally in Rettner Atrium or Havens Lounge (across the hall) when other events kick us out of our room. This time varies slightly from week to week and semester to semester depending on other groups, but there will always be juggling between 7:30 - 9:00pm (and sometimes even until 9:30pm). Some weekends we have workshops where we work on specific circus acts for beginners and experts. For those interested in performing, we have additional rehearsals to work on shows. If you would like an up-to-date schedule, please join our mailing list and get in contact with us.</p>

				<h3>What we do</h3>

					<div>

						<p>We do more than just juggling! We have members with a wide range of abilities in juggling balls, clubs, and rings; passing; diabolo; poi; unicycle; walking on globes (really large balls); fire juggling, eating, and breathing; knife juggling; flow wand; and so on. We have all sorts of club equipment at practices, so there's no need to bring or even own juggling balls or other equipment.</p>

						<p>Anyone is welcome to our informal practices and workshops to learn new skills or share their knowledge. We love new people; come hang out with us! Do not be intimidated if you do not know how to juggle because we can teach anyone. If you do know some juggling that is awesome; we do a lot of passing, endurance, combat and other fun group activities.</p>
